    "## Decision tree model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**\n",
    "- Decision trees are widely used and powerful for machine learning tasks, especially in competitions, despite limited academic attention.\n",
    "- In this module, decision trees are explored through a binary classification example (cat vs. non-cat) using three categorical features: ear shape, face shape, and whiskers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Terminology:**\n",
    "1. **Decision Tree:** A tree-like model that splits data based on features to make predictions.\n",
    "2. **Node:**\n",
    "   - **Root Node:** The topmost node where the model starts (e.g., ear shape).\n",
    "   - **Decision Nodes:** Intermediate nodes where decisions are made to split data (e.g., face shape).\n",
    "   - **Leaf Nodes:** Terminal nodes that provide the final prediction (e.g., cat or not cat).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Structure:**\n",
    "- **Root Node → Decision Nodes → Leaf Nodes**\n",
    "- Each decision node looks at a feature and splits based on its value, guiding the sample down the tree.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Given an animal with pointy ears, round face, and whiskers, the tree:\n",
    "   - Starts at the root (ear shape).\n",
    "   - If pointy, goes left to check face shape.\n",
    "   - If round, moves to a leaf node predicting the animal is a cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features:**\n",
    "- Features can be categorical (e.g., pointy vs. floppy ears) or continuous (covered later).\n",
    "- Binary classification (yes/no) is demonstrated here, but decision trees can handle multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Trees:**\n",
    "- There are numerous possible decision trees for any dataset.\n",
    "- The decision tree learning algorithm selects the tree that performs well on both the training and cross-validation sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- Decision trees handle categorical features well.\n",
    "- Splitting on features helps divide data into homogeneous sets.\n",
    "- The tree model grows based on training examples and generalizes to new test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Upcoming Topics:**\n",
    "- Handling continuous features.\n",
    "- Tree ensembles, such as random forests and boosting, which combine multiple decision trees for better accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short Notes for Revision:**\n",
    "- **Root node:** Starting point (e.g., ear shape).\n",
    "- **Decision nodes:** Intermediate nodes (e.g., face shape).\n",
    "- **Leaf nodes:** Final prediction (cat or not).\n",
    "- **Features:** Categorical (discrete values); continuous to be covered later.\n",
    "- **Goal of algorithm:** Find a tree that generalizes well to unseen data (test set).\n",
    "- **Tree learning:** Chooses splits that maximize data homogeneity in each branch.\n",
    "- **Multiple tree models:** Different trees can perform differently; algorithm picks the best.\n"

    "## Learning Process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps in Building a Decision Tree:**\n",
    "1. **Choosing the Root Node:** \n",
    "   - Start by selecting a feature to split on at the root node. For example, the \"ear shape\" feature could split the data into two groups: pointy ears and floppy ears.\n",
    "   - This decision is made based on an algorithm (covered later) that aims to maximize purity at each split.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Splitting Data:** \n",
    "   - Once you choose a feature for the root, split the data accordingly. For example, animals with pointy ears go left, and those with floppy ears go right.\n",
    "   - Repeat the process on each subset of data (left or right branch) by selecting another feature to split on. For instance, use \"face shape\" for one subset and split again.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating Leaf Nodes:** \n",
    "   - When all the examples in a subset belong to the same class (all cats or all dogs), create a leaf node that makes a prediction. For example, if all examples in a group are cats, the leaf node will predict \"cat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeating the Process:** \n",
    "   - Continue splitting the data on both sides of the tree until no further meaningful splits can be made. For example, after splitting on the \"whiskers\" feature, both branches might result in pure nodes (all cats or all dogs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Decisions in Tree Construction:**\n",
    "1. **Feature Selection at Each Node:** \n",
    "   - The goal is to choose a feature that maximizes purity. Purity refers to creating subsets where all examples belong to the same class. For example, if you had a \"cat DNA\" feature, it would perfectly split cats from dogs and result in pure subsets.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **When to Stop Splitting:**\n",
    "   - Stop splitting when a node contains only one class (100% purity), or other criteria like:\n",
    "     - Reaching a maximum depth (a parameter that limits tree size to prevent overfitting).\n",
    "     - Minimum improvement in purity (if the gain from splitting is too small).\n",
    "     - A minimum number of examples at a node (stop splitting if the subset is too small).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Considerations:**\n",
    "- **Tree Depth:** The depth is the number of hops from the root to a node. Limiting tree depth can help avoid overfitting and keep the model manageable.\n",
    "- **Stopping Criteria:** Different researchers have proposed various criteria for stopping, such as limiting depth, minimum purity improvement, and minimum examples at a node. These refinements create a more flexible and effective decision tree algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Thoughts:**\n",
    "- Decision tree learning involves many decisions: feature selection, stopping criteria, and more. The next step is understanding how to measure impurity using entropy, which helps determine the best feature to split on."

    "## Measuring purity\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture introduces the concept of **entropy** in the context of decision trees, focusing on how to measure the **impurity** of a set of examples. Here's a summary of key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Entropy as a Measure of Impurity**: \n",
    "   - Entropy quantifies how mixed a set of examples is. If all examples are of one class (e.g., all cats or all dogs), the set is pure, and the entropy is zero.\n",
    "   - When the set is a 50-50 split (e.g., 3 cats and 3 dogs), it is most impure, and the entropy is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mathematical Definition of Entropy**:\n",
    "   - The entropy function, denoted \\( H(p_1) \\), where \\( p_1 \\) is the fraction of positive examples (e.g., cats), is defined as:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     H(p_1) = -p_1 \\log_2(p_1) - (1 - p_1) \\log_2(1 - p_1)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - It measures how pure or impure a set is based on the distribution of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Examples to Illustrate Entropy**:\n",
    "   - **50-50 Split**: Entropy = 1 (maximum impurity).\n",
    "   - **All Cats or All Dogs**: Entropy = 0 (complete purity).\n",
    "   - **Other Splits**: As the fraction of one class increases, entropy decreases, showing reduced impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Logarithmic Convention**:\n",
    "   - Entropy uses a log base 2 by convention, making the peak value of entropy equal to 1.\n",
    "   - Special cases like $ 0 \\log(0) $ are treated as zero to avoid undefined expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Comparison to Gini Index**:\n",
    "   - The Gini impurity is another function used for decision trees, and it behaves similarly to entropy but with slight differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Application to Decision Trees**:\n",
    "   - Entropy helps determine the **purity** of a node in a decision tree, guiding which feature to split on. The next step is using entropy to make those splitting decisions.\n"

    "### Building a Decision Tree: Recursive Process and Stopping Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of constructing a decision tree involves recursive splitting of the dataset, guided by information gain. Here’s an overview of the decision tree building steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start at the Root Node**:\n",
    "   - Begin with all training examples at the root.\n",
    "   - Calculate **information gain** for all possible features.\n",
    "   - Split on the feature that provides the **highest information gain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Split the Data**:\n",
    "   - After choosing a feature to split on, divide the dataset into subsets based on that feature.\n",
    "   - Send each subset to the corresponding left or right branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Splitting**:\n",
    "   - For each branch, treat the subset of data as if it were the entire dataset.\n",
    "   - Recompute information gain for all remaining features.\n",
    "   - Choose the best feature for the next split.\n",
    "   - Keep repeating this process for both the left and right subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stopping Criteria**:\n",
    "   - The recursion continues until one or more of the following criteria are met:\n",
    "     - **Entropy is zero**: All examples in the node belong to a single class (pure node).\n",
    "     - **Maximum tree depth**: The tree has reached a predefined maximum depth.\n",
    "     - **Information gain threshold**: If the additional split provides very little information gain (less than a set threshold), stop.\n",
    "     - **Minimum number of examples**: If a node contains fewer than a threshold number of examples, stop splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Leaf Nodes**:\n",
    "   - Once the stopping criteria are met for a node, it becomes a **leaf node**.\n",
    "   - The leaf node will make a prediction based on the majority class of the examples in that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Root Node Split\n",
    "- **Feature selection**: Compute information gain for all features. \n",
    "   - Example: Ear Shape has the highest information gain.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Right Subtree\n",
    "- **Check stopping criteria**: Continue splitting if the node contains mixed classes.\n",
    "- **Feature selection**: Compute information gain for Whiskers, Face Shape, etc.\n",
    "   - Example: Whiskers has the highest information gain.\n",
    "- **Split**: Create sub-branches for Whiskers **present** vs. **absent**.\n",
    "  - Left branch: Predict **cat**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Recursion and Recursive Algorithm:\n",
    "- Building the decision tree is a **recursive process**:\n",
    "   - The decision tree at the root node is built by constructing smaller decision trees at each subtree.\n",
    "   - This is a classic example of **recursion** in computer science.\n",

    "### Overfitting and Tree Complexity:\n",

    "   - Start at the root node.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, we covered how to deal with categorical features that can take on more than two values by using **one-hot encoding**. Here's a quick summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem Setup**: The feature \"ear shape\" can take on three discrete values: pointy, floppy, and oval. This differs from previous examples where features could only take two values (like pointy vs. floppy).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **One-Hot Encoding**:\n",
    "    - Instead of using one feature that can take on three values (pointy, floppy, oval), we split this feature into **three binary features**:\n",
    "        - \"Has pointy ears?\" (1 if true, 0 if false),\n",
    "        - \"Has floppy ears?\" (1 if true, 0 if false),\n",
    "        - \"Has oval ears?\" (1 if true, 0 if false).\n",
    "    - This encoding ensures that **only one feature** in this set will take the value of 1 for each example, and all others will be 0. That's why it's called \"one-hot\" encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **General Approach**:\n",
    "    - If a categorical feature has **k possible values**, we replace it with **k binary features** that take the value 0 or 1. This method can be applied in many machine learning models, such as decision trees, neural networks, and logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compatibility with Decision Trees**:\n",
    "    - After applying one-hot encoding, the decision tree treats these new binary features in the same way it would handle any other binary feature, making it easy to adapt the algorithm without modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use in Neural Networks**:\n",
    "    - One-hot encoding can also be used for models like neural networks, which require numerical input. Encoding categorical variables as binary features (0 and 1) allows these models to process them as numerical inputs.\n"

    "    - **Calculate Information Gain**: For each candidate threshold, calculate the resulting information gain.\n",
    "    - **Choose the Best Threshold**: Select the threshold that provides the highest information gain and use it to split the data.\n",

    "   - **Variance**: Measures how spread out the target values (weights) are in a subset. A lower variance means that the values are closer together, which is desirable for making predictions.\n",

    "## Using multiple decision trees\n",
    "\n",
    "To enhance the robustness of decision trees and reduce their sensitivity to small changes in the training data, you can use an ensemble of decision trees. Here’s a summary of how this approach works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tree Ensembles Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Problem with Single Decision Trees**:\n",
    "   - **Sensitivity to Data**: A single decision tree can be highly sensitive to small variations in the data. For example, changing just one training example can lead to different splits and therefore a different tree structure.\n",
    "   - **Instability**: This instability makes single decision trees less reliable for making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tree Ensemble Approach**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: A tree ensemble is a collection of multiple decision trees used together. Instead of relying on a single decision tree, you use several trees to make predictions.\n",
    "   - **Voting Mechanism**: For classification tasks, each tree in the ensemble makes a prediction, and the final prediction is determined by majority voting. For regression tasks, predictions are averaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Build an Ensemble of Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Multiple Trees**:\n",
    "   - **Diverse Trees**: To build a robust ensemble, each tree should be trained on slightly different versions of the training data. This diversity helps in making the ensemble more stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sampling with Replacement**:\n",
    "   - **Concept**: Sampling with replacement is a technique where multiple subsets of the training data are created by randomly sampling with the possibility of selecting the same example more than once.\n",
    "   - **Bootstrapping**: This method is also known as bootstrapping and is used to create different training sets for each tree in the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training with Bootstrapping**:\n",
    "   - **Generate Samples**: Create several bootstrap samples from the original training data. Each sample is a random subset of the data, where some examples may be repeated.\n",
    "   - **Train Trees**: Train a decision tree on each bootstrap sample. Since the data subsets are different, the trees will likely make different decisions and have different structures.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Sampling with replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling with replacement is a crucial technique for building robust ensembles of decision trees. Here’s a summary of how it works and its application in creating tree ensembles:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling with Replacement\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concept**:\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Sampling with replacement involves drawing elements from a dataset and then returning them to the dataset before drawing again. This means each draw is independent of previous draws.\n",
    "   - **Example**: If you have four colored tokens (red, yellow, green, blue) and sample with replacement, you might get sequences like green, yellow, blue, blue, where some tokens might appear more than once or not at all in a given sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process**:\n",
    "   - **Draw and Replace**: You draw a token from the bag, note its color, replace it back into the bag, and then draw again. This process ensures that each draw is independent.\n",
    "   - **Multiple Draws**: Repeating this process many times creates multiple random samples from the same set of tokens, which allows for variability in each sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application to Building Tree Ensembles\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generating Training Sets**:\n",
    "   - **Training Set Creation**: For an ensemble of trees, you use sampling with replacement to create multiple training sets from the original dataset. Each training set is the same size as the original but may contain duplicate examples and may not include all examples from the original set.\n",
    "   - **Example**: If your original dataset has 10 examples, you would create new datasets of 10 examples each by randomly sampling with replacement from the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training Multiple Trees**:\n",
    "   - **Ensemble Construction**: Train a separate decision tree on each of these bootstrapped datasets. Since each dataset is different, each tree will learn slightly different patterns from the data.\n",
    "   - **Diversity**: This diversity among trees helps improve the robustness of the ensemble, as the overall prediction is less sensitive to any single tree’s variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advantages**:\n",
    "   - **Robustness**: By averaging or voting among multiple trees, the ensemble reduces the impact of any single tree’s errors or biases.\n",
    "   - **Improved Performance**: Tree ensembles often outperform individual decision trees because they combine the strengths of multiple models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling with replacement is used to generate multiple training datasets for each decision tree in the ensemble. This approach helps in creating diverse trees, which, when combined, lead to a more robust and accurate prediction model. In the next video, you’ll see how to use these samples to construct and aggregate the decision trees into a powerful ensemble."

    "## Random forest algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Forest Algorithm Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest algorithm is an advanced tree ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification and regression performance. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Creating Multiple Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Sampling with Replacement**:\n",
    "     - You start with a training set of size $M$.\n",
    "     - For each tree in the ensemble, create a new training set by sampling with replacement from the original dataset. This new training set will also have size $M$, but may include duplicates and miss some original examples.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Training Decision Trees**:\n",
    "     - Train a decision tree on each of these new training sets.\n",
    "     - Repeat this process $B$ times (where $B$ is the number of trees, typically around 100).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Voting for Predictions**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Making Predictions**:\n",
    "     - When a prediction is needed, each tree in the forest makes its own prediction.\n",
    "     - Combine the predictions from all trees using a majority vote (for classification) or averaging (for regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Performance**:\n",
    "     - This ensemble approach reduces the sensitivity of the model to individual data points and improves robustness and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Randomizing Feature Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Feature Subset Selection**:\n",
    "     - To further enhance the diversity of the trees, at each node of a tree, randomly select a subset of features rather than considering all features.\n",
    "     - Typically, if there are $N$ features, you randomly choose $K$ features (where $K$ is often set to $\\sqrt{N}$) and use only those $K$ features to determine the best split.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Benefits**:\n",
    "     - This random feature selection helps prevent trees from becoming too similar to each other, increasing the diversity and strength of the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Advantages of Random Forest**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Robustness**:\n",
    "     - By averaging predictions across many trees, the Random Forest algorithm is less sensitive to overfitting and variations in the data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Accuracy**:\n",
    "     - Random Forest often provides more accurate predictions than individual decision trees due to its ensemble approach and randomization.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Performance**:\n",
    "     - Although increasing the number of trees $B$ generally improves performance, very large values of $B$ (like 1000) may lead to diminishing returns and slower computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Bagged Decision Trees**:\n",
    "     - Random Forest can also be referred to as a bagged decision tree method because it involves creating multiple trees from bootstrap samples of the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Random Forest**:\n",
    "     - The random feature selection adds another layer of randomness to further enhance the diversity and performance of the trees.\n"

    "## XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "### XGBoost Algorithm Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced version of the boosting technique that enhances the performance of decision trees. It’s widely used due to its efficiency, speed, and effectiveness in both competitions and commercial applications. Here’s a detailed look at how XGBoost works and its advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Boosting Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Boosting**:\n",
    "     - Boosting is a technique where each new model focuses on the mistakes made by the previous models.\n",
    "     - Instead of training each tree on a random subset of the data, boosting adjusts the weight of examples based on previous errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Deliberate Practice Analogy**:\n",
    "     - Similar to focusing on weak parts of a piano piece during practice, boosting focuses on the examples that are misclassified by previous trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **How XGBoost Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Initial Model**:\n",
    "     - Train an initial decision tree on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Error Focusing**:\n",
    "     - For subsequent trees, increase the chance of picking misclassified examples from the previous model.\n",
    "     - This adjustment is achieved by updating the weights of the training examples, giving higher weights to those that were misclassified.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Iteration**:\n",
    "     - Repeat this process for $B$ iterations, where each new tree tries to correct the errors of the combined previous trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Mathematical Complexity**:\n",
    "     - The exact way to adjust the weights involves complex calculations, but the open-source libraries handle these details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **XGBoost Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Efficiency**:\n",
    "     - XGBoost is designed to be fast and efficient, avoiding the need for generating multiple training sets through sampling with replacement.\n",
    "     - Instead of sampling, XGBoost assigns weights to examples, making it more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Regularization**:\n",
    "     - XGBoost includes built-in regularization to prevent overfitting, which helps in improving generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Implementation**:\n",
    "     - The open-source XGBoost library simplifies the use of this algorithm.\n",
    "     - Example code to use XGBoost for classification:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       import xgboost as xgb\n",
    "       model = xgb.XGBClassifier()\n",
    "       model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "       predictions = model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "     - For regression, use `XGBRegressor` instead of `XGBClassifier`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Practical Use**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Competitions**:\n",
    "     - XGBoost is highly competitive in machine learning competitions, such as those on Kaggle.\n",
    "     - It’s known for its performance in predictive tasks and is a popular choice among data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Comparison to Random Forest**:\n",
    "     - While Random Forest uses bagging (sampling with replacement) and averages multiple trees, XGBoost uses boosting to focus on correcting errors from previous models, often leading to superior performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **When to Use**:\n",
    "     - XGBoost is a powerful tool for both classification and regression tasks and is often preferred for its speed and accuracy.\n"
