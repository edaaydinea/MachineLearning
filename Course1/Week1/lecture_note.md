# Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

## What is machine learning?

- **Definition by Arthur Samuel:**
  - Machine Learning: The field of study that enables computers to learn without explicit programming.
  - Example: Samuel's checkers-playing program, developed in the 1950s.
    - Samuel was not a skilled checkers player.
    - The program played tens of thousands of games against itself.
    - By analyzing outcomes, the program learned which positions were advantageous or disadvantageous.
    - Result: The program eventually surpassed Samuel's own checkers skills.

- **Quiz Insight:**
  - More learning opportunities generally lead to better performance by the algorithm.
  - The aim of quizzes is to reinforce understanding, not just to get answers correct on the first attempt.

- **Types of Machine Learning:**
  - **Supervised Learning:**
    - Most commonly used in real-world applications.
    - Focus of the first two courses in this specialization.

    - Includes techniques like recommender systems and reinforcement learning.

- **Practical Application of Algorithms:**
  - Importance of knowing how to effectively apply machine learning tools.
  - Understanding practical application is crucial, beyond just having the tools.
  - Example: An experienced team might struggle if they don't apply best practices, even with advanced tools.

- **Course Goals:**
  - To equip learners with both tools and the skills to apply them effectively.
  - To provide insights into best practices for developing valuable machine learning systems.
  - Aim: To avoid common pitfalls and ensure successful application of machine learning methods.

  - **Classification:**
    - Another major type of supervised learning (to be explored in the next video).

## Supervised learning part 2

- **Classification Definition:**
  - Classification algorithms predict output categories from a given input.
  - Unlike regression, which predicts continuous numbers, classification deals with a finite set of possible categories.

- **Example: Breast Cancer Detection:**
  - **Objective:** Detect whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using medical records.
  - **Data Representation:**
    - Tumors are labeled as either 0 (benign) or 1 (malignant).
    - Data can be plotted with the horizontal axis representing tumor size and the vertical axis showing 0 or 1.
  - **Classification vs. Regression:**
    - **Classification:** Predicts from a small set of possible categories (e.g., 0 or 1).
    - **Regression:** Predicts from a range of possible continuous numbers (e.g., house prices).

- **Multi-Class Classification:**
  - Classification can handle more than two categories.
  - Example: Predicting types of cancer (Type 1, Type 2, etc.).
  - Terms "output classes" and "output categories" are used interchangeably.

- **Application with Multiple Inputs:**
  - Example: Predicting tumor malignancy using both tumor size and patient age.
  - Data Plotting: Different symbols (e.g., circles for benign and crosses for malignant) are used to differentiate categories.
  - **Boundary Line:**
    - The learning algorithm finds a boundary to separate categories.
    - Helps predict whether a new patient's tumor is benign or malignant based on the input data.

- **Complex Data:**
  - In practice, more inputs may be used for accurate predictions (e.g., tumor thickness, cell size uniformity).
  - Machine learning models may handle multiple input features to improve predictions.

- **Summary:**
  - **Supervised Learning:**
    - Maps input (x) to output (y) using labeled data.
    - **Regression:** Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices).
    - **Classification:** Predicts categories (e.g., benign or malignant).

## Unsupervised learning part 1

  - **Example 2: DNA Microarray Data:**
    - Measures gene activity across individuals.
    - Clustering can group individuals into types based on genetic activity, identifying patterns such as susceptibility to certain traits or preferences.
  - **Example 3: Customer Segmentation:**
    - Companies use clustering to segment customers into different market segments.
    - Example: DeepLearning.AI's community segmentation into groups based on learning motivations.

# Regression Model 

## Linear Regression model part 1

#### **Supervised Learning:**
- **Definition:** In supervised learning, the data includes both inputs \( x \) and corresponding output labels \( y \). The goal is to train a model to predict the output \( y \) for new inputs \( x \) based on the patterns learned from the training data.
- **Key Types:**
  - **Regression:** Predicts continuous numeric values. Example: Predicting house prices based on size.
  - **Classification:** Predicts discrete categories or labels. Example: Diagnosing diseases or classifying images.

#### **Linear Regression Model:**
- **Purpose:** Fits a straight line to the data to predict a continuous output variable based on one or more input features.
- **Example Problem:** Predicting house prices based on the size of the house.
  - **Dataset:** Contains house sizes and prices.
  - **Model:** Fits a line to the data points.
  - **Prediction:** For a house size of 1250 square feet, the model estimates a price of approximately $220,000.

#### **Model Terminology and Notation:**
- **Training Set:** The dataset used to train the model.
- **Input Variable (Feature):** Denoted as \( x \). Example: Size of the house.
- **Output Variable (Target):** Denoted as \( y \). Example: Price of the house.
- **Training Example:** A single data point in the training set, represented as \((x, y)\).
- **Number of Training Examples:** Denoted as \( m \). Example: 47 examples.
- **Specific Training Example Notation:** \((x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\), where \( i \) is the index of the training example. Example: \((2104, 400)\) for the first example.

## Linear Regression model part 2

#### **How Supervised Learning Works:**
1. **Input Dataset:**
   - **Training Set:** Contains both input features \( x \) (e.g., size of the house) and output targets \( y \) (e.g., price of the house).
   
2. **Training the Model:**
   - **Algorithm:** The supervised learning algorithm uses the training set to learn and produce a function \( f \) (previously called a hypothesis) that can make predictions.
   - **Function \( f \):** Denoted as \( f(x) \), where \( x \) is the input feature, and \( f(x) \) is the prediction (denoted as \( \hat{y} \) or "y-hat"). The function estimates the output \( y \).

3. **Prediction:**
   - **Model Output:** The model uses the learned function \( f \) to make predictions for new inputs. For example, for a house size of 1250 square feet, the model predicts a price (e.g., $220,000).

#### **Linear Regression Model:**
- **Function Representation:**
  - **Formula:** The linear regression function can be written as \( f_w,b(x) = w \cdot x + b \), where \( w \) (weight) and \( b \) (bias) are parameters determined during training.
  - **Simplified Notation:** Sometimes written as \( f(x) = wx + b \).

- **Purpose:**
  - **Fitting a Line:** Linear regression fits a straight line to the data points, allowing predictions based on the linear relationship between the input and output.

- **Why Linear Function:**
  - **Simplicity:** Linear functions are simple and easy to work with. More complex models (non-linear) can be considered later, but starting with linear regression provides a solid foundation.

- **Univariate Linear Regression:**
  - **Definition:** Linear regression with one input feature \( x \). Also known as univariate linear regression, where "univariate" means one variable.

- **Extension:**
  - **Multivariate Linear Regression:** Later, you may encounter models with multiple input features (e.g., size of the house, number of bedrooms).

#### **Cost Function:**
- **Importance:** The cost function measures how well the model's predictions match the actual output values. Constructing and minimizing the cost function is crucial for training the model effectively.

## Cost function formula

#### **1. Defining the Cost Function:**
- **Purpose:** To measure how well the model (linear function) fits the training data.
- **Model Function:** \( f_{w, b}(x) = wx + b \)
  - **Parameters:** \( w \) (weight) and \( b \) (bias).
  - **Prediction:** \( \hat{y}_i = f_{w, b}(x_i) \)

#### **2. Error Measurement:**
- **Error for Training Example \( i \):**
  - **Difference:** \( \hat{y}_i - y_i \) (where \( y_i \) is the true target).
  - **Squared Error:** \( (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2 \)
  
#### **3. Summing Up Errors:**
- **Total Squared Error:**
  - **Formula:** \( \text{Sum of } (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2 \) for all training examples \( i \) from 1 to \( m \) (where \( m \) is the number of training examples).

#### **4. Averaging the Error:**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**
  - **Formula:** \( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2 \)
  - **Purpose:** To normalize the error by the number of training examples so that the cost function is not affected by the size of the dataset.

#### **5. Final Cost Function:**
- **Formula:** \( J(w, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2 \)
  - **Additional Division by 2:** Included to simplify the derivative calculation later in optimization.

#### **6. Intuition Behind the Cost Function:**
- **Objective:** Minimize \( J(w, b) \) to find the best-fitting line. A smaller cost indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the true values.
- **Interpretation:**
  - **Large Cost Function Value:** The model's predictions are significantly off from the actual targets.
  - **Small Cost Function Value:** The model's predictions are close to the actual targets.

## Cost function intuition

1. **Cost Function Basics**:
   - The cost function \( J(w, b) \) measures how well the model's predictions match the actual target values.
   - For linear regression, the model is \( f(x) = wx + b \), where \( w \) and \( b \) are the parameters you adjust.

2. **Formulation**:
   - The cost function computes the squared error between the predicted values \( \hat{y}_i \) (from the model) and the actual target values \( y_i \).
   - The formula for the cost function is:
     \[
     J(w, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f(x_i) - y_i \right)^2
     \]
   - Here, \( m \) is the number of training examples, and \( \frac{1}{2} \) is included for convenience in later calculations.

3. **Visualizing the Cost Function**:
   - **Simplified Case (Single Parameter)**:
     - With \( f(x) = wx \) (setting \( b = 0 \)), the cost function depends only on \( w \).
     - Different values of \( w \) lead to different lines on the graph, and the cost function \( J(w) \) measures how well each line fits the data.
     - For each \( w \), compute \( J(w) \) by calculating the squared errors and averaging them.

   - **Example Calculation**:
     - For \( w = 1 \): The line perfectly fits the training data, so \( J(w) = 0 \).
     - For \( w = 0.5 \): The line doesn't fit as well, leading to a higher cost \( J(w) \).
     - For \( w = 0 \): The line is horizontal (fit is poor), resulting in a high cost \( J(w) \).

4. **Choosing Optimal Parameters**:
   - The goal is to find \( w \) (or \( w \) and \( b \) in the full case) that minimizes the cost function \( J \).
   - A lower cost indicates a better fit to the training data.

5. **Full Case (Two Parameters)**:
   - With both \( w \) and \( b \), the cost function becomes a function of two variables.
   - This is visualized in a 3D plot, where one axis represents \( w \), another represents \( b \), and the third axis shows the cost \( J(w, b) \).


## Visualizing the cost function

### 1. **Visualizing the Cost Function**

- **Previous Visualization:** We previously looked at the cost function \( J(w) \) with a single parameter \( w \), resulting in a U-shaped curve. This curve represents how the cost varies with \( w \) alone.

- **Current Visualization:** Now, we are considering the cost function \( J(w, b) \) with both parameters \( w \) and \( b \). This creates a more complex surface plot. The 3D surface plot of \( J(w, b) \) resembles a bowl or hammock, showing how \( J \) changes with both parameters.

### 2. **3D-Surface Plot**

- **Description:** The 3D surface plot has \( w \) and \( b \) as the horizontal axes and the cost \( J \) as the vertical axis. Each point on this surface represents a particular combination of \( w \) and \( b \) and the corresponding cost value.

- **Interpreting the Plot:** The height of the surface at any point corresponds to the cost \( J \) for those specific values of \( w \) and \( b \). The goal is to find the point on this surface where the cost \( J \) is minimized.

### 3. **Contour Plot**

- **Description:** A contour plot is a 2D representation of the same cost function. It shows contours (or levels) of constant cost \( J \) by slicing the 3D surface horizontally. Each contour represents a set of \( (w, b) \) pairs that yield the same cost.

- **Interpreting the Plot:** The contour plot displays ellipses (or ovals) where each ellipse represents the points on the 3D surface with the same height. The center of these ellipses is where the cost function is minimized.

### 4. **Practical Application**

- **Finding Optimal Parameters:** To find the best parameters \( w \) and \( b \), you would look for the point where \( J(w, b) \) is minimized. This point corresponds to the bottom of the bowl in the 3D plot or the center of the smallest ellipse in the contour plot.

- **Visualization Summary:** By using both 3D surface and contour plots, you gain a better understanding of how different combinations of \( w \) and \( b \) affect the cost function and how to choose the optimal parameters for your linear regression model.

## Visualization examples

In this segment, the focus is on visualizing different choices of parameters \( w \) and \( b \) and how they affect the fit of the model and the corresponding cost. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. **Visualization of Cost for Different Parameters**

- **Example 1:**
  - **Parameters:** \( w \approx -0.15 \), \( b \approx 800 \)
  - **Function:** \( f(x) = -0.15x + 800 \)
  - **Fit:** This line does not fit the data well, as seen from its high cost on the cost function plot.

- **Example 2:**
  - **Parameters:** \( w = 0 \), \( b \approx 360 \)
  - **Function:** \( f(x) = 360 \)
  - **Fit:** This line is a flat line (horizontal) and provides a slightly better fit than the first example, but still not ideal.

- **Example 3:**
  - **Parameters:** Different \( w \) and \( b \) values.
  - **Function:** Line not specified but noted as not fitting well compared to the previous example.

- **Example 4:**
  - **Parameters:** \( w \) and \( b \) resulting in a line that fits the data well.
  - **Function:** This line fits the data closely, with the cost function \( J(w, b) \) near the minimum, indicating a good fit.

### 2. **Understanding the Cost Function**

- **High Cost:** Lines that do not fit the data well have a higher cost value, which is far from the minimum on the cost function plot.
- **Low Cost:** Lines that fit the data well have a lower cost value, close to the center of the smallest ellipse on the contour plot.

### 3. **Interactive Visualization**

- **Contour Plot:** In the optional lab, you can interact with a contour plot to see how different values of \( w \) and \( b \) affect the fit of the model. Clicking on the plot will show the corresponding line and cost.
- **3D Surface Plot:** The lab also includes a 3D surface plot that you can rotate to better understand the shape of the cost function.

### 4. **Gradient Descent Introduction**

- **Objective:** To find the optimal parameters \( w \) and \( b \) that minimize the cost function \( J(w, b) \). This is done more efficiently than manually analyzing plots.
- **Algorithm:** Gradient descent is a key algorithm used to adjust \( w \) and \( b \) iteratively to minimize the cost function. It is fundamental in machine learning for training various models.

# Train the model with gradient descent

## Gradient descent

### 1. **Overview of Gradient Descent**

- **Objective:** The goal is to minimize a cost function \( J(w, b) \) by finding the optimal parameters \( w \) and \( b \) that yield the smallest cost.
- **Applicability:** Gradient descent can be used for various functions, not just linear regression. It's applicable to more complex models with multiple parameters.

### 2. **Algorithm Process**

- **Starting Point:** Begin with initial guesses for parameters \( w \) and \( b \). For linear regression, these can often be set to zero.
- **Iteration:** Gradually adjust the parameters to reduce the cost \( J(w, b) \) until the cost function stabilizes at or near its minimum.

### 3. **Understanding Gradient Descent**

- **Visualization:** Imagine a hilly landscape where you want to find the lowest point (the valley).
  - **Direction of Steepest Descent:** At any point on the hill, the optimal direction to move downhill is the direction where the slope is steepest. This is the direction of the gradient.
  - **Steps:** Take small steps in this direction to move downhill. Repeat this process until you reach the bottom of the valley (local minimum).

### 4. **Challenges with Gradient Descent**

- **Local Minima:** The algorithm might converge to different local minima based on the starting point. Each valley represents a local minimum, and gradient descent might get stuck in one depending on where it starts.

### 5. **Next Steps**

- **Mathematical Expressions:** The next video will delve into the mathematical details of gradient descent and how to implement it efficiently.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Gradient descent is crucial for optimizing functions and is widely used in machine learning.
- It helps in finding the optimal parameters by minimizing the cost function.
- The process involves iterative adjustments and understanding the direction of steepest descent.
- Gradient descent may converge to different local minima based on the initial starting point.

## Implementing gradient descent

In this video, the focus is on implementing the gradient descent algorithm, which is crucial for optimizing parameters in machine learning models. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the key points covered:

### 1. **Gradient Descent Algorithm**

- **Update Rule:**
  - For parameter \( w \):
    \[
    w \leftarrow w - \alpha \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial w}
    \]
  - For parameter \( b \):
    \[
    b \leftarrow b - \alpha \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial b}
    \]
  - Here, \( \alpha \) (alpha) is the **learning rate**, which controls the size of the steps you take in the direction of the gradient. 

### 2. **Understanding the Symbols**

- **Assignment Operator:** In programming, `=` is used to assign a new value to a variable. It’s different from mathematical equality where `a = b` means `a` and `b` are equal.
- **Learning Rate (α):** This is a small positive number (e.g., 0.01) that determines the step size. A larger \( \alpha \) means bigger steps, while a smaller \( \alpha \) means smaller steps.
- **Derivative Term:** This term, \( \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial w} \) or \( \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial b} \), tells you the direction to move to reduce the cost function. It represents the slope of the cost function with respect to each parameter.

### 3. **Simultaneous Updates**

- **Correct Implementation:**
  - Compute the updates for both \( w \) and \( b \) using their respective gradient terms.
  - Store the results in temporary variables (e.g., `temp_w` and `temp_b`).
  - Update \( w \) and \( b \) simultaneously using these temporary variables.

  ```python
  temp_w = w - alpha * dJ_dw
  temp_b = b - alpha * dJ_db
  w = temp_w
  b = temp_b
  ```

- **Incorrect Implementation:**
  - If you update \( w \) before \( b \), the updated \( w \) will be used in calculating the new gradient for \( b \), leading to incorrect updates.

  ```python
  temp_w = w - alpha * dJ_dw
  w = temp_w
  temp_b = b - alpha * dJ_db
  b = temp_b
  ```

### 4. **Gradient Descent Process**

- **Iteration:** Repeat the update steps until the parameters \( w \) and \( b \) converge to values where the cost function \( J(w, b) \) no longer significantly changes.

### 5. **Next Steps**

- The next video will delve into the details of the derivative term, which is essential for calculating the gradient. This involves understanding calculus concepts, but you don’t need advanced calculus knowledge to implement gradient descent effectively.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Gradient descent is used to optimize parameters by minimizing the cost function.
- The learning rate \( \alpha \) controls the step size in the optimization process.
- Implement gradient descent with simultaneous updates for accuracy.
- The next video will cover the derivative term, which is crucial for computing gradients.


## Gradient descent intuition

### 1. **Gradient Descent Overview**

- **Update Rule for Single Parameter \( w \):**
  \[
  w \leftarrow w - \alpha \frac{dJ(w)}{dw}
  \]
  - **\( \alpha \)**: Learning rate, controls the step size.
  - **\( \frac{dJ(w)}{dw} \)**: Derivative of the cost function \( J \) with respect to \( w \).

### 2. **Derivative Term**

- **Derivative Interpretation:**
  - At any point on the cost function \( J(w) \), the derivative represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve.
  - **Positive Derivative:** The tangent line slopes upwards, meaning the cost function is increasing. Gradient descent will move \( w \) to the left to decrease the cost.
  - **Negative Derivative:** The tangent line slopes downwards, meaning the cost function is decreasing. Gradient descent will move \( w \) to the right to increase the cost.

### 3. **Examples**

- **Starting Point with Positive Derivative:**
  - If you start at a point where the derivative is positive, gradient descent will decrease \( w \). Moving to the left on the cost function curve will reduce the cost, which is desired.

- **Starting Point with Negative Derivative:**
  - If you start at a point where the derivative is negative, gradient descent will increase \( w \). Moving to the right on the cost function curve will reduce the cost, aligning with the goal.

### 4. **Role of Learning Rate \( \alpha \)**

- **Learning Rate:**
  - **Too Small:** If \( \alpha \) is very small, the steps taken in gradient descent will be tiny, making convergence very slow.
  - **Too Large:** If \( \alpha \) is very large, the steps might be too big, potentially overshooting the minimum and causing divergence.

### 5. **Choosing Learning Rate**

- The learning rate \( \alpha \) is crucial for the efficiency of gradient descent. Choosing an appropriate value involves:
  - **Empirical Testing:** Often, you need to experiment with different values of \( \alpha \) to find one that works well.
  - **Monitoring Convergence:** Adjust \( \alpha \) based on how quickly and smoothly the algorithm converges.

### 6. **Next Steps**

- **Exploring Learning Rate \( \alpha \):** The next video will delve into the nuances of choosing a good learning rate and understanding its impact on gradient descent.

**Key Takeaways:**

- The derivative term guides the direction of parameter updates in gradient descent.
- The learning rate \( \alpha \) affects the size of each step in the optimization process.
- Understanding and tuning \( \alpha \) is essential for effective gradient descent.

## Learning rate

### 1. **Learning Rate Effects**

- **Too Small Learning Rate:**
  - **Scenario:** Gradient descent starts at a point on the cost function \( J(w) \) and takes very tiny steps due to a very small \( \alpha \) (e.g., \( 0.0000001 \)).
  - **Outcome:** The updates to \( w \) are so small that the convergence to the minimum is very slow. The algorithm will eventually reach the minimum, but it will require many iterations and considerable time.

- **Too Large Learning Rate:**
  - **Scenario:** Gradient descent starts close to the minimum but takes very large steps because of a large \( \alpha \). This can cause the algorithm to overshoot the minimum.
  - **Outcome:** The updates to \( w \) can cause it to move away from the minimum, leading to increased cost values and divergence from the optimal solution. The algorithm may never converge and could oscillate or diverge completely.

### 2. **Effect on Local Minima**

- **Already at a Local Minimum:**
  - **Scenario:** When \( w \) is at a local minimum, the derivative \( \frac{dJ(w)}{dw} \) is zero.
  - **Outcome:** Gradient descent updates \( w \) to \( w - \alpha \times 0 \), which means \( w \) remains unchanged. Thus, the algorithm effectively stops at this local minimum and does not alter \( w \) further.

### 3. **Convergence Behavior**

- **Automatic Step Size Reduction:**
  - **Scenario:** As gradient descent progresses, the value of \( w \) gets closer to the local minimum.
  - **Outcome:** The derivative \( \frac{dJ(w)}{dw} \) decreases, leading to smaller update steps. Even with a fixed learning rate, the steps become smaller as the algorithm converges towards the minimum.

### 4. **Summary and Next Steps**

- **Learning Rate \( \alpha \):**
  - Choosing \( \alpha \) is critical; too small results in slow convergence, and too large risks overshooting or divergence.
  - Empirical testing is often required to find a suitable \( \alpha \).

- **Gradient Descent Algorithm:**
  - It minimizes a cost function \( J \) by iteratively updating parameters based on the derivative.
  - The algorithm adapts to the function landscape and reduces step sizes as it approaches a local minimum.

## Gradient descent for linear regression

### 1. **Gradient Descent for Linear Regression**

- **Model:** Linear regression model: \( f(x) = wx + b \)
- **Cost Function:** Squared error cost function:
  \[
  J(w, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (f(x^i) - y^i)^2
  \]
  where \( f(x^i) = wx^i + b \)

- **Gradient Descent Updates:**
  - **Derivative with respect to \( w \):**
    \[
    \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (f(x^i) - y^i) x^i
    \]
  - **Derivative with respect to \( b \):**
    \[
    \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (f(x^i) - y^i)
    \]

  - **Gradient Descent Algorithm:**
    \[
    w := w - \alpha \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial w}
    \]
    \[
    b := b - \alpha \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial b}
    \]
    where \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.

### 2. **Derivation of Derivatives**

- **With Respect to \( w \):**
  - Substitute \( f(x^i) = wx^i + b \) into the cost function.
  - Differentiate with respect to \( w \), leading to:
    \[
    \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (wx^i + b - y^i) x^i
    \]

- **With Respect to \( b \):**
  - Substitute \( f(x^i) = wx^i + b \) into the cost function.
  - Differentiate with respect to \( b \), leading to:
    \[
    \frac{\partial J(w, b)}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (wx^i + b - y^i)
    \]

### 3. **Convexity and Global Minimum**

- **Convex Cost Function:**
  - The squared error cost function is convex, meaning it has a single global minimum.
  - Gradient descent will converge to this global minimum, provided the learning rate \( \alpha \) is chosen appropriately.

### 4. **Implementation**

- **Gradient Descent Steps:**
  - Initialize \( w \) and \( b \).
  - Update \( w \) and \( b \) iteratively using the gradients until convergence.
  - Ensure the learning rate \( \alpha \) is set to balance convergence speed and stability.

## Running gradient descent

### 1. **Initial Setup**

- **Initial Values:**
  - \( w = -0.1 \)
  - \( b = 900 \)
  - This initializes the model \( f(x) = -0.1x + 900 \).

- **Plots Provided:**
  - **Model and Data Plot:** Shows how the initial straight line fits the data.
  - **Contour Plot:** Visualizes the cost function as a contour plot.
  - **Surface Plot:** Provides a 3D view of the cost function.

### 2. **Gradient Descent Updates**

- **First Step:**
  - The model parameters \( w \) and \( b \) are updated.
  - The cost function moves from one point to a new point, indicating a reduction in cost.
  - The model fit line changes slightly.

- **Subsequent Steps:**
  - Each step updates \( w \) and \( b \) further, progressively improving the fit.
  - The cost function continues to decrease.
  - The straight line fit to the data becomes closer to the optimal fit.

### 3. **Convergence to Global Minimum**

- **Visualization:**
  - As gradient descent progresses, the cost function and model fit improve.
  - Eventually, the model reaches a global minimum, representing the best fit line for the data.

### 4. **Batch Gradient Descent**

- **Definition:**
  - Batch gradient descent refers to using the entire training dataset to compute the gradient at each step.
  - In contrast to stochastic or mini-batch gradient descent, which use subsets of the data.

- **Naming:**
  - The term "batch gradient descent" is used in the machine learning community, and "The Batch" newsletter from DeepLearning.AI is named after this concept.
